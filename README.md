# Web of Things Middleware Platform
WoT Project is a Web of Things middleware platform that turns a Raspberry-Pi to a WoT server. The main target of this project is to run and test WoT architecture on a simulated smart home scenario. This sample code tries to implement some basic functionalities of Smart Home application including climate, lighting and security controlling and monitoring.

## Requirements
At first step, you need to prepare some kind of requirements to run this code.
Requirements of this project are divided into Hardware and Software as below.

### Hardware Requirements
* [Raspberry-Pi 3](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/)  Model B or B+
* [DHT11/22](https://learn.adafruit.com/dht) sensor
* [PIR](https://learn.adafruit.com/pir-passive-infrared-proximity-motion-sensor/how-pirs-work) motion sensor
* Some LEDs in colors of Red, Green, Blue

### Software Requirements
Since this code should run on Raspberry-Pi, the following software have to install on Raspberry. It is strongly recommended to use [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/) as main OS on Raspberry-Pi.

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* Driver [bcm2835](https://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/)

## Installation
When preparing requirements is done, you can clone this repository on your Raspberry-Pi and setup hardware and software.

### Hardware Setup
To setup your hardware on Raspberry-Pi, follow this instruction according to [schematic plan](#The-Schematic-of-Hardware-Assembling):

1. Open a [Raspberry-Pi pinout](https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2012/06/simple-guide-to-the-rpi-gpio-header-and-pins/) to guide you that which pin has what number. Also the pinout of [DHT11](https://components101.com/sensors/dht11-temperature-sensor) and [PIR](https://components101.com/sensors/hc-sr501-pir-sensor) motion sensor would be helpful.

2. Connect 5v VCC and GND pins of Raspberry-Pi to power rails of breadboard.

3. Set the DHT11 on the breadboard and connect its VCC and GND pins to power rails of breadbaord. Then Connect DHT11 pin-2 to GPIO-14 of Raspberry-Pi. 
   > __Notice__: Do not forget that connect a pull-up resistor to pin 2 of DHT11. Otherwise, your sensor doesnâ€™t work properly.

4. Connect GPIOs 25, 8, 7 to positive leg of your LEDs, respectively. Then connect negative LEDs legs by resistor to GND of breadboard power rails.

5. In the same way, connect alert LED to GPIO 20.

6. Connect VCC and GND pins of PIR sensor to power rails. Then according to [schematic plan](#The-Schematic-of-Hardware-Assembling), connect positive leg of PIR LED with a resistor to power rails and then connect negative leg to PIR Data pin and GPIO 21. Note that PIR LED should be sited between the Data pin of PIR sensor and Raspberry-Pi GPIO.

7. Congratulation, your hardware project is ready! :clap: :dancer:

4. Run the code by: ` sudo npm run dev` or `sudo node main.js`
    > __Notice__: This code must run in administrator mode. So, *don't forget using `sudo`*.

5. If the application works well and perfect, you should see some kind of result on terminal screen.
        
    ![The Promised Running Result](./docs/running_app_status.png "Running Result")

6. Now open your browser, on the Raspberry- Pi or on the other device on the same network, and test the program by entering this API: `http://Raspberry_IP:8080/`.

Your first WoT application is running on the Raspberry-Pi. Please feel free to change the code and hardware to make your favorite WoT project.

### Configuration

To configure hardware or software, you should modify `resources.json` file in `src/resources/`. This file enables you to modify port number, sensors, and actuators information. 

## APIs EndPoint 
The below table lists all APIs that you can use to interact with WoT Middleware Platform. We recommend to use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) or any similar options like `curl`, `axios` or etc. to use these APIs to create requests.

## Sotware Architecture and Design Approach

The main architecture of this system is based on __Layered Architecture Style__ that is a suitable architecture for this type of IoT program. However, we leverages _Node.js_ module structure to constructe the scripts and codes.


### Software Architecture
As depicted on [system architecture](#Architecture-of-WoT-Middleware-Platform), include three major layer as Application, Middleware, and Things layer that each of them is responsible to support some system functionalities. In following, we detail each layer. 

#### Application Layer

In application layer, vendor developers can use APIs of this system to add, some or entire, system functionalities into their applications.

#### Middleware Layer

The main goal of Middleware, in such IoT architecture, is to act like a intermediate layer between Application and Things layers. Middleware layer is responsible to make functionalities of devices accessible on applications. in summary, Middleware layer get the raw data from devices by using hardware or software connector (GPIOs or network connection) and turn them into some high level (business) services. Technically, there are many types of middlewares that could be used in the IoT architecture such as, event-based, VM-based, or etc. However, we leverage [Web of Things](https://webofthings.org/) to create our Middleware layer. The architecture of Web of Things uses fundamental and technical Web technologies to develop such IoT applications that would be used in many scenarios. Therefore, we use _Node.js_ by Express framework to develop our WoT Middleware Platform on Raspberry-Pi.

#### Things Layer

Things layer is such devices or sensors that we used in our work. In this system, Raspberry-Pi as main server, is enable us to connect these sensors (DHT11 and PIR) and actuators (LEDs) directly by using some GPIOs.

### Module Structure

In the following we describe functionalities and responsibility of each module separately.

* `Main.js`: This module is defined to run program by starting all sub modules.

* `src/server`: this module contains all servers of program including:
   1. HTTP.js: HTTP server is responsible for provide a web server to process requests and responses. This module is using Express.js framework.

   2. Websocket.js: Websocket module creates a two way communication between server and user's browser (_push server_) to send value of temperature and humidity in real-time manner.

* `src/routes`: All functionalities of entire system are turning into some services and representing through some APIs. Route module as a dependency of HTTP.js module is responsible to create some REST APIs. So, this module separates into sub modules for representing specific services as follows:

* `src/model`: This module is provide a data model for program. Of course, we using a _JSON_ file to create our resources, however, it can be replaced by any type of data modeling. You can use a _SQLight_ database to create and store your models.

* `src/plugin`: Every piece of hardware like sensors or LEDs that we used in our system needs a script code to initialize and run in our program. So, this module responsible for containing these scripts. Each script, depending on supporting hardware, needs a specific _Library_ or _SDK_ in order to provide communication ability with certain hardware.
